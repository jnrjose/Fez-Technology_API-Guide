title: "Authentication"
description: "To interact with the Edge API, you’ll need to authenticate your requests using a token. This token is generated from your API credentials and is required for all API calls."
---

## Getting Your Token

To generate your authentication token, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Your API Credentials Page:**  
   Log in to your Edge dashboard and go to the API Credentials section to retrieve your client and secret keys.

2. **Generate the Token:**  
   Combine your client and secret keys, and encode them in Base64 format. This will create the token you need for authentication.

3. **Include the Token in Your Requests:**  
   Add the generated token to the `Authorization` header of your API requests.

- **`tokenType`:** Indicates the type of token, typically `Bearer`.
- **`expiresAt`:** The duration (in seconds) before the token expires and needs to be refreshed.
- **`message`:** A message indicating the result of the request, here showing `"Success"`.
- **`status`:** The status of the request, with `"success"` indicating the request was processed correctly.

## Base URL

When making API requests, you'll need to use the appropriate base URL depending on the environment:

- **Production Environment:**  
  Use this URL for live, production-level operations:

  ````http
  https://api.withedge.co/ ```

  ````

- **Sandbox environment:**  
  Use this URL for testing and development purposes. The sandbox environment mirrors the production environment but is intended for safe testing without affecting real data:
  ````http
  https://sandbox.api.withedge.co/v1```
  ````

<Info>
	Ensure that you are using the correct base URL for your environment to avoid
	unintended data manipulation or errors. For testing, always start with the
	sandbox environment before moving to production.
</Info>
<Warning>
	For security reasons, ensure that your token is stored securely and never
	shared publicly. Tokens should be refreshed regularly to maintain secure
	access to the API.
</Warning>
--- ## Key Points

- **Environment URLs:**
  - Clearly distinguishes between production and sandbox environments.
  - Use the sandbox environment for testing and development.
- **Code Blocks:**
  - URLs are provided in separate code blocks for easy copying and pasting.
- **Info Callouts:**
  - Important notices are highlighted to ensure proper usage and security practices.
  - Always verify you're using the correct environment and keep your tokens secure.

## How Does It Work?

<ol>
	<li>
		Initiating a Transfer Request: To start a transfer, you need to specify the
		account you want to send money from, the account you want to send money to,
		and the amount you wish to transfer. You can also add a short note to
		explain the reason for the transfer.
	</li>
	<li>
		Validate a Transfer Request: Once you've initiated a transfer request,the
		owner of the source account is required to provide the OTP sent to his/her
		phone number in order to validate the transaction.
	</li>
	<li>
		Checking Transfer Status: After a transaction has been successfully
		validated, you can check to see if it's been completed. The status will let
		you know if the transfer is still processing, if it's been completed
		successfully, or if there was an issue.
	</li>
</ol>

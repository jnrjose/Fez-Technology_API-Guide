# SafeLocker API

The Safe Locker API is a structured collection of endpoints developed to facilitate secure storage and retrieval of items, optimized for logistics and delivery use cases. Designed with security as a priority, the API supports various stages of the delivery process, including item registration, tracking, management, and secure access protocols. This API is ideal for scenarios where sensitive items need temporary, protected storage before reaching their final destination.

## Overview of the Safe Locker API

The Safe Locker API offers extensive functionality for registering items into lockers, accessing stored items, managing locker contents, and securely transferring or tracking ownership. This API can be integrated into larger logistics and delivery systems where reliable parcel, document, or valuable item management is essential.

This documentation provides a detailed guide for interacting with the Safe Locker API, covering major operations from item registration to locker management and access control. Below is an overview of the primary features included:

## Key Features

### Item Registration and Storage

- **Secure Item Registration**: Register items into lockers using unique identifiers, ensuring safe storage.
- **Metadata Management**: Add metadata such as item descriptions, owner information, and access constraints upon registration, allowing precise tracking and control.

### Access and Retrieval Management

- **Secure Access Protocols**: Access lockers through OAuth or API key authentication methods.
- **Authorized Retrieval**: Only authorized personnel can retrieve items, ensuring items remain protected from unauthorized access.

### Locker and Inventory Management

- **Locker Content Management**: Query, update, and track locker contents in real time.
- **Locker Availability**: Dynamically check and assign available lockers based on custom criteria.

### Secure Transfer and Ownership Updates

- **Transfer Protocols**: Securely transfer items between users or locations.
- **Ownership Tracking**: Track item ownership changes, supporting logistics operations with precise custody transfer records.

### Notifications and Alerts

- **Event Notifications**: Configure notifications for critical events like item deposit, retrieval, or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Receive real-time alerts for lockers requiring immediate attention, enhancing responsiveness.

## Typical Use Cases

The Safe Locker API is highly versatile, addressing multiple scenarios, including:

- **Logistics and Delivery Services**: Securely store and deliver sensitive packages or documents to verified users only.
- **E-Commerce**: Enable customers to pick up items from lockers using one-time passwords or secure access codes.
- **Enterprise Security**: Manage confidential documents within secure lockers, allowing controlled access and audit trails.
- **Courier and Parcel Services**: Centrally manage parcel storage during multi-leg delivery routes, supporting high-volume operations.

## Getting Started

To start using the Safe Locker API, ensure you have an API key and access credentials. For authentication and environment setup details, refer to the [Authentication](#authentication) section.

## Authentication

The Safe Locker API uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication. Each request to the API must include a valid access token. To obtain a token, make a request to the authentication endpoint as shown below:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.fezsafelocker.com/oauth/token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
          "client_id": "your-client-id",
          "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
          "grant_type": "client_credentials"
         }'
```

A successful request returns a JSON response with the access token:

```json
{
  "access_token": "your-access-token",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

Include the token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent API requests:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.fezsafelocker.com/items" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token"
```

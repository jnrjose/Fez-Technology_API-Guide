title: Authorization and Authentication
description: Learn how to authenticate and authorize requests to the Safe Locker API, including obtaining tokens and managing API keys securely.
---

To ensure secure access to the Safe Locker API, each request requires a valid access token obtained via OAuth 2.0. This section covers the steps for authenticating your requests, managing API credentials, and understanding token expiration and refreshing.

---

## Overview

The Safe Locker API employs **OAuth 2.0** as the authentication mechanism, providing secure access to API endpoints. Each request must include an `Authorization` header with a valid token to access resources. This setup allows you to maintain secure connections while managing your API credentials effectively.

---

## Step 1: Obtain API Credentials

After setting up your account on the Fez SafeLocker dashboard, follow these steps to obtain your **client ID** and **client secret**:

1. **Log in to the Dashboard**: Go to the Fez SafeLocker portal and log in.
2. **Navigate to API Settings**: In the settings section, locate **API Settings** or **Developer** options.
3. **Generate Credentials**: Click **Create API Key** to generate your client ID and secret. Copy these credentials and store them securely, as they will only be visible once.

> **Note**: Treat your credentials as sensitive information. Avoid embedding them in public code repositories or sharing them openly.

---

## Step 2: Obtain an Access Token

With your client ID and secret, request an access token. This token will authenticate all subsequent API calls.

**Token Request Endpoint**: `POST /oauth/token`

**Request Example**:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.fezsafelocker.com/oauth/token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
          "client_id": "your-client-id",
          "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
          "grant_type": "client_credentials"
         }'
```

**Response Example**:

```json
{
  "access_token": "your-access-token",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

### Explanation of Response Fields
- **access_token**: The token to be included in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests.
- **token_type**: The type of token issued, typically `Bearer`.
- **expires_in**: The token's expiration time in seconds (e.g., 3600 seconds = 1 hour).

> **Note**: Access tokens expire after a specified duration (typically 1 hour). Ensure you refresh your token to maintain uninterrupted access.

---

## Step 3: Use the Access Token in Requests

After obtaining an access token, include it in the `Authorization` header for all API requests. This authenticates each call, granting access to resources within your permission scope.

**Example Request with Token**:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.fezsafelocker.com/lockers/available" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token"
```

---

## Step 4: Refreshing an Expired Token

Once the token expires, you’ll need to request a new one using the same client ID and secret. If using `grant_type: client_credentials`, a new token request is required as there is no refresh token mechanism for this flow.

**Request Example**:

Repeat the request in **Step 2** to obtain a new token.

## API Key Security Best Practices

To secure your credentials, follow these best practices:
- **Store Keys Securely**: Keep API keys in a secure location, like environment variables or secure vaults.
- **Avoid Public Repositories**: Never expose API keys or tokens in public repositories or hardcode them in your application.
- **Rotate Keys Regularly**: Periodically regenerate your client secret and update your application to use the new credentials.
- **Limit Access**: Restrict API key usage to specific IP addresses or applications where feasible.

## Common Errors and Troubleshooting

| Error Code | Description                               | Solution                                              |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 401        | Unauthorized – Invalid or missing token   | Ensure the `Authorization` header includes a valid token. |
| 403        | Forbidden – Insufficient permissions      | Verify your API key permissions or contact support.   |
| 429        | Too Many Requests – Rate limit exceeded   | Reduce request frequency or contact support for quota details. |

## Example Authentication Workflow

1. **Generate Credentials**: Retrieve client ID and secret from the dashboard.
2. **Request Access Token**: Use the credentials to get an access token.
3. **Make API Calls**: Include the access token in the `Authorization` header of each request.
4. **Refresh Token as Needed**: Request a new token once the current one expires.

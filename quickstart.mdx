## Step 1: Sign Up for a Safe Locker Account

1. **Navigate to the Sign-Up Page**: Go to the Fez SafeLocker portal at [https://portal.fezdelivery.co/signup](https://portal.fezdelivery.co/signup).
2. **Fill in the Registration Form**: Provide the necessary information:
   - **Name**: Full name of the representative.
   - **Email**: Business email address for account communication.
   - **Organization Details**: Business name, registration number, and contact information.

3. **Complete Registration**: Submit the form to create your account.
4. **Verify Your Email**: After signing up, check your email for a verification link. Click the link to verify your account 
5. **Create Password**: A secure password for accessing the account and activate API access.

## Step 2: Obtain Your API Credentials

Once your account is activated, follow these steps to obtain the API credentials required for making requests:

1. **Log in to Your Dashboard**: Head to the Fez SafeLocker dashboard at [https://portal.fezdelivery.co/login](https://portal.fezdelivery.co/login) and enter your registered email and password.
2. **Navigate to API Settings**:
   - In your dashboard, locate the **API Settings** or **Developer** section.
   - Click **Create API Key** to generate a new API key for your application.
3. **Save Your API Key and Secret**:
   - Once generated, the API key and secret will be displayed. Copy and store them in a secure location, as they will be used for authenticating requests.
   - Note: For security, the API secret may only be displayed once upon generation.

> **Important**: Treat your API credentials as sensitive information. Avoid sharing them publicly or embedding them in publicly accessible code.

## Step 3: Generate an Access Token

The Safe Locker API uses OAuth 2.0 for secure access. Use your API credentials (client ID and client secret) to obtain an access token. This token will authenticate your API requests.

**Request Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.fezdelivery.co/oauth/token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
          "client_id": "your-client-id",
          "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
          "grant_type": "client_credentials"
         }'
```

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "access_token": "your-access-token",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

> **Note**: This token is valid for a limited time (e.g., 1 hour). You will need to refresh the token upon expiration.

---

## Step 4: Make Your First API Call

With your access token, you can now make your first API call! Below is an example for retrieving available lockers:

**Endpoint**: `GET /lockers/available`

**Request Example**:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.fezsafelocker.com/lockers/available" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token"
```

**Response Example**:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "locker_id": "12345",
      "location": "Downtown Hub",
      "size": "Large",
      "status": "Available"
    },
    {
      "locker_id": "67890",
      "location": "Airport Hub",
      "size": "Medium",
      "status": "Available"
    }
  ]
}
```

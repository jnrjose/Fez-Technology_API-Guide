## Safe Locker API

The Safe Locker API is a structured collection of endpoints developed to facilitate secure storage and retrieval of items, typically for logistics and delivery use cases. Its design ensures that various stages of the delivery process, such as item registration, tracking, and management, can be performed efficiently while maintaining a high level of security. This API is particularly suited for scenarios where sensitive items need to be stored temporarily before being delivered to the end recipient.

## Overview of the Safe Locker API

The Safe Locker API supports functionalities such as registering items into lockers, accessing stored items, managing locker contents, and securely transferring the ownership or tracking of these items. This API can be integrated into broader delivery systems, where companies or platforms need reliable methods to manage parcels, secure documents, or other valuables.

This documentation aims to provide detailed information on how to interact with the Safe Locker API, covering all major operations, from item registration to locker management and secure access protocols. Below is a more detailed explanation of the Safe Locker API components:
